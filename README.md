# Hotel Management System (Multi-Branch)

## Overview
A centralized hotel management system that supports multiple branches under one company.
It enables administrators, branch managers, and receptionists to manage rooms, bookings,
check-ins/outs, staff, and payments from a single unified platform.

The system aims to simplify daily hotel operations while providing real-time visibility
of occupancy, revenue, and performance across branches.


## Vision
To build a secure, scalable, and easy-to-use system that unifies management
of all hotel branches under one dashboard.

## Primary Goals
1. Allow the head office to monitor and control all branches.
2. Ensure each branch has its own rooms, staff, and bookings separated logically.
3. Provide customers with smooth online booking and payment experiences.
4. Generate accurate analytics and reports across all branches.
5. Maintain clear role-based access control for security.

## User Roles
- **Super Admin / Head Office:** Manage branches, view global reports.
- **Branch Manager:** Manage rooms, bookings, and staff of their branch.
- **Receptionist:** Handle daily check-ins/outs and payments.
- **Customer:** Search rooms, book, and pay online.
- **Support Staff:** Update room cleaning and maintenance status.

## Version 1 Scope (MVP)
- Multi-branch structure with separate data sets.
- Room CRUD operations per branch.
- Booking flow with date validation and status updates.
- Basic authentication and role management.
- Dashboard showing current bookings and occupancy.

## Motivation
This project is part of my learning journey in backend development.
It will demonstrate how to design, develop, and deploy a production-ready application using
Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.
